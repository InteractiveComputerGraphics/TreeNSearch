TreeNSearch TODO
================

	* Hardcode CompactNSearch for the foam generator
	* Take it to splishsplash (need to be there by Lukas' submission)
	* Bugs
		- Doesnt work for few amount of particles with more than one sets.
			- Empty point sets?
			- Broken for few particles with large cells ??

	* GitHub
		* Optionally specify a different taskflow and libmorton folders
		* CI and badges
			
	* Future work:
		* Method to free memory without creating a new one.
		* Particles far away.
		* callback function to not store neighborlists
		* Check with the cannon with static particles.
			Without static sets are we 5% slower? 50% slower? Not slower at all?
